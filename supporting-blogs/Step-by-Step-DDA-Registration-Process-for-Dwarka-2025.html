            <h2>Preparing Before Registration</h2>

          <p>
            Before you begin the DDA Dwarka registration process for 2025, it‚Äôs
            important to make sure you meet the eligibility requirements and

            but also reduces the risk of your application being rejected during
            verification.
          </p>

            <h3>Check Eligibility</h3>

            <p>

            <h3>Gather Required Documents</h3>

            <p>
              Applicants should keep digital copies of the following documents ready for upload:
            </p>

            <ul>

              <li>Recent passport-sized photographs</li>

            </p>

            <h3>Know Your Category</h3>

            <p>

              <li>MIG/HIG: No fixed limit, but financial proof is needed</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 1 ‚Äì Visit the Official Portal</h2>

          <p>
             The registration process for the DDA Housing Scheme 2025 begins on the official website: www.dda.org.in. This is the only authorized platform for submitting applications, making payments, and checking allotment results. Applicants should avoid third-party portals or agents, as DDA does not accept offline applications.
          </p>

            <h3>Creating Your Account</h3>

           <p>
            To start, click on the ‚ÄúDDA Housing Scheme 2025‚Äù link on the homepage and select the registration option. You will be asked to:
           </p> 

            <ul>
              <li>Enter your name, date of birth, Aadhaar number, and PAN card number.</li>
              <li>Provide mobile number and email ID for verification through OTP.</li>
              <li>Create a username and password for logging into the portal later.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Once submitted, your profile will be created and you can access the application form.</p>

            <h3>Common Issues to Avoid</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Ensure that the details you enter exactly match those on Aadhaar and PAN cards, as mismatches may delay verification.</li>
              <li>Use an active mobile number and email ID since all updates, including allotment status and payment reminders, are sent digitally.</li>
              <li>Do not use multiple registrations for the same household ‚Äî this will lead to cancellation of all applications.</li>
            </ul>
              <br>
            <p>
              By completing this step correctly, applicants set a strong foundation for the rest of the process.

              Ensure the details match official documents such as Aadhaar, PAN, and voter ID.
            </p>

            <h3>Uploading Documents</h3>

           <p>

            </p>

            <h3>Draft Save and Final Submission</h3>
          
          <p>
            Applicants can save the form as a draft and return later to complete it. Once finalized, the form should be reviewed carefully before submission. Editing after submission is not allowed.

          <p>
          After completing the application form, the next step in the DDA Dwarka registration process 2025 is paying the application fee. This fee acts as an earnest deposit and shows the applicant‚Äôs commitment. The amount depends on the flat category selected.
          </p>

            <ul>
              <li>EWS/LIG: ‚Çπ25,000 ‚Äì ‚Çπ50,000</li>

            </ul>
              <br>
            <p>
              The fee is refundable if you do not secure an allotment. Refunds are usually processed within 30‚Äì45 days after the draw or e-auction.
            </p>

            <h3>Payment Methods</h3>

            <p>

            <h2>Step 4: Allotment Models Explained</h2>
          <p>
            The allotment stage determines who gets a flat under the DDA Housing Scheme 2025. Depending on the flat category, DDA uses different models to ensure fairness and transparency.
          </p>

          <h3>Draw of Lots</h3>

          <p>
            For EWS and LIG flats, allotment is done through a computerized lottery system, also called a draw of lots. Every valid application has an equal chance, and results are published on the DDA portal.
          </p>

          <h3>First Come First Serve (FCFS)</h3>

          <p>
            In select cases, especially under Jan Sadharan Awaas Yojana or leftover inventory, flats are allotted on a first come first serve basis. This means faster applicants have higher chances of securing a unit.
          </p>

          <h3>E-Auction</h3>

          <p>
            For MIG, HIG, and premium flats, allotments are made via online e-auction. Applicants place bids above the reserve price, and the highest bidders are allotted the flats. This method is commonly used in Dwarka‚Äôs premium sectors like 16B and 19B.
          </p>

          <h3>Transparency</h3>

          <p>
            Each model is conducted digitally and results are publicly available, ensuring transparency. Applicants can check their allotment status online within hours of the result announcement.

            <h2>Step 5: Receiving the Allotment Letter</h2>

          <p>
            Applicants who are successful in the draw of lots, FCFS, or e-auction will receive an allotment letter from DDA. This document is proof that a flat has been officially allotted in your name and contains important details such as:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Flat number and sector (e.g., Dwarka Sector 14, 16B, or 19B).</li>
            <li>Total cost of the flat, including parking (if applicable).</li>
            <li>Payment schedule and deadlines.</li>
            <li>Instructions for further documentation.</li>
          </ul>
            <br>
          <p>
            The allotment letter is made available for download directly on the DDA portal. Applicants are advised to keep both a digital copy and printed copy, as the letter is required for loan applications and final possession.
            Failure to make payments within the timeline specified in the allotment letter may result in cancellation of the allotment.
          </p>

        </section>

        <section id="buyer-tips">

          <h2>Step 6: Making Payments After Allotment</h2>
          
          <p>
            Once the allotment letter is issued, applicants must make payments as per the DDA schedule. This is a crucial step because delays or non-payment can lead to cancellation of the flat.
          </p>

          <h3>Initial Payment</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Generally, 25% of the total flat cost must be paid within 90 days of receiving the allotment letter.</li>
            <li>This payment includes adjustment of the application fee already deposited.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>Balance Payments</h3>

          <p>
            The remaining amount is payable in installments or as a lump sum, depending on the flat type:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>MIG/HIG flats: Staggered payments through installments.</li>
            <li>SFS (Self-Financing Scheme): Linked to construction progress, ensuring buyers pay as work advances.</li>
            <li>Premium flats: Often require larger upfront payments.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>Loan Integration</h3>

          <p>
            Most buyers choose to finance their purchase through bank loans. The allotment letter can be submitted to banks like SBI, HDFC, or PNB for faster loan processing. By making payments on time, applicants safeguard their allotment and move closer to possession.<br> <br>

          <article>
            <h2>Step 7: Document Verification & Possession</h2>

          <p>
            After completing the payment schedule, applicants must undergo document verification before taking possession of their flat. This step ensures that all information provided during registration matches official records.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Verification Process
          </h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Submit original documents such as Aadhaar, PAN, income proof, and the allotment letter.</li>
            <li>Provide payment receipts for installments made</li>
            <li>If applicable, submit caste/disability/war widow certificates for reserved categories.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>
            Once verified, DDA issues a possession letter, which allows buyers to legally occupy their flat. At this stage, keys are handed over, and ownership is formally transferred.
          </p>

          <h3>Timeline</h3>

          <p>
            For ready-to-move flats, possession is typically granted within 3‚Äì6 months. For newly constructed units, the process may take 6‚Äì12 months, depending on completion status. <br>
            This step marks the end of the registration journey and the beginning of homeownership in Dwarka.

            Common Mistakes to Avoid
          </h2>

          <p>

            Despite DDA simplifying the process in 2025, many applicants lose their chance at owning a flat due to avoidable mistakes. Being aware of these pitfalls can help ensure a smooth registration and allotment.
          </p>

          <h3>
            1. Missing Deadlines
          </h3>

          <p>
            DDA announcements come with strict timelines for registration, payment, and document submission. Missing even one deadline can lead to automatic cancellation of your application. Always set reminders and track updates on the official portal.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Incorrect or Mismatched Documents
          </h3>

          <p>
            Many applications are rejected because the information in Aadhaar, PAN, or income proof does not match the details entered in the online form. Ensure consistency across all documents before uploading.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Wrong File Formats or Sizes
